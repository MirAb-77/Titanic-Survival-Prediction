# Titanic Survival Prediction Model: Unveiling the Fateful Voyage

The Titanic prediction model is a fascinating journey into the past, aiming to predict whether a passenger survived or perished during the tragic sinking of the Titanic. This endeavor utilizes a rich dataset to uncover patterns and insights, transforming historical data into a modern machine-learning marvel.

## 🚢 Dataset Description

Step aboard the Titanic dataset, available on Kaggle, where every row tells a story from that fateful night. Explore the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset).

Here’s a glimpse of the key features that guide our prediction model:

- **Pclass**: Which deck were you on? This column reveals the passenger class:
  - 1 = First Class 🛳️
  - 2 = Second Class 🛳️
  - 3 = Third Class 🛳️

- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger:
  - 0 = Female 👩
  - 1 = Male 👨

- **Age**: How old were you? Age of the passenger in years.

- **SibSp**: Family ties aboard the Titanic:
  - Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

- **Parch**: Extending the family:
  - Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic 👵👴

- **Fare**: How much did your ticket cost? Ticket fare paid by the passenger 💷

- **Embarked**: Where did you board the ship? Port of Embarkation:
  - 0 = Cherbourg 🇫🇷
  - 1 = Queenstown 🇮🇪
  - 2 = Southampton 🇬🇧

- **Survived**: The ultimate outcome:
  - 0 = Did not survive 💔
  - 1 = Survived 💖
